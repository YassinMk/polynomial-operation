# Polynomial Operations

This repository contains a C program for performing various operations on polynomials.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Main program file containing the main function and example usage of polynomial operations.
- `polynome.c`: Implementation file with functions for polynomial operations.
- `polynome.h`: Header file with structure and function prototypes.
  
## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/polynomial-operations.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd polynomial-operations
    ```

3. Compile the program:

    ```bash
    gcc main.c polynome.c -o polynomial
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./polynomial
    ```

### How to Use
